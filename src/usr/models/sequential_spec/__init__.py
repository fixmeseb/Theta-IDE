"""Spec-driven sequential models, kept in the repo rather than installed.

src/usr/models/ is component territory, but this is not a research model: it
is the interpreter the visual model builder writes configs for. A button in
the Experiment panel cannot depend on a Hub install to work, so it stays
tracked through a .gitignore negation because it is a generic IDE feature,
while other models installed into this directory remain component territory.

Importing the module is what registers the architecture; auto_discover_models
imports each package under src/usr/models/, so nothing in model_registry.py
had to change.
