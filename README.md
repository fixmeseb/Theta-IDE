ThetaIDE is a desktop IDE and experiment pipeline for reinforcement learning and deep learning research. You
compose experiments from Hydra configs, launch training on your machine, watch metrics stream in live, and
compare runs side by side. The pipeline is built on PyTorch Lightning and Hydra.

Algorithms, models and environments are components. A fresh clone ships the framework without them; you
install the ones you need from the **Theta Hub**, a registry that includes Stable-Baselines3 and d3rlpy suites,
MLP, CNN, ResNet, LSTM and Transformer models, Gymnasium and Atari environments, and neuro-symbolic models
such as BlendRL, NSFR and NEUMANN. You can also write your own: see the
[Component Plugin Authoring Guide](docs/COMPONENT_PLUGIN_GUIDE.md).

## Install

Python 3.10–3.13 is required. Python 3.14 is not supported yet: Hydra 1.3 fails on it at startup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CameronEgb/Offline-BlendRL.git
cd Offline-BlendRL
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) covers Windows, optional extras such as Atari, and how to verify the install.

## Run your first experiment

1. Start the IDE from the repository root:

   ```bash
   python -m frontend
   ```

2. In the **Components** tab, open the Hub (the globe button at the top) and install **ThetaIDE Basics**. It
   brings Stable-Baselines3, Gymnasium classic control and the basic network models.
3. In the **Experiment** tab, open `thetaide/cartpole_ppo_reference` and press **F5** to launch it.
4. Watch it train in the **Monitor** tab, then compare runs in **Results**.

Press **F1** for the built-in documentation, or **Ctrl+Space** to jump to any panel, plugin or command.

## Command line

The IDE and the command line run the same pipeline. Experiments are named `<group>/<experiment>`, after their
YAML file under `in/config/experiment/`:

```bash
# Train an experiment (install its components from the Hub first)
python run_pipeline.py thetaide/cartpole_ppo_reference

# Hydra overrides go after the name
python run_pipeline.py thetaide/cartpole_ppo_reference total_timesteps=2000 seed=1

# Validate the config without training
python run_pipeline.py thetaide/cartpole_ppo_reference dry_run=true
```

Each command-line run writes its results under the recipe's `experiment_id`, replacing the previous run with
that ID. Pass `experiment_id=<new name>` to keep both. (Runs launched from the IDE get a unique, timestamped ID.)

`python run_pipeline.py --help` lists the orchestration overrides (`plot_only`, `no_plot`,
`no_online`, `no_offline` and more).

### Component overrides in experiments

Open a group default or individual experiment in the **Experiment** panel and use the **Data Loaders**, **Evaluators**, and **Figures** boxes to choose components. Selecting a component fills its first level of parameters from the installed profile; you can edit those defaults or add custom parameters. Inherited selectors show the resolved component name. Individual recipes inherit group values until they add an override. The same fields can be written directly in an experiment YAML:

```yaml
data_module:
  name: tabular_data
  params:
    batch_size: 32
evaluator:
  name: my_evaluator
  params:
    threshold: 0.8
plot_overrides:
  losses:
    smoothing_window: 7
```

`data_module` and `evaluator` also accept a registered name as a string. `plots` selects figures as a list or mapping; `plot_overrides` adjusts a figure's parameters without changing that selection. Existing `plots.<figure>` options still work. Evaluators can implement Lightning's `Callback`, the `evaluate(model, data_source, cfg)` protocol, or the evaluation hook methods `on_eval_start`, `evaluate_step`, and `on_eval_end`. Evaluator parameters can include `enabled: false`; `frequency: 2` runs evaluation hooks every second validation epoch.

Plots and reports are generated automatically at the end of a run. To regenerate them, pass the run's ID,
which is its folder name under `results/logs/<group>/`:

```bash
python plot/manager.py thetaide/cartpole_ppo_baseline --wipe
```
