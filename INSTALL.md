# Installing ThetaIDE

This guide sets up the training pipeline and the desktop IDE in one virtual environment, then checks that
both work. For a tour of the IDE once it is running, press **F1** inside it.

---

## 1. Requirements

- **Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13.** Python 3.14 is not supported yet: Hydra 1.3 fails on it with
  `ValueError: badly formed help string` as soon as training starts. If your system Python is 3.14 (current
  Arch and Fedora), install an older one with your package manager, `pyenv` or `uv` (see below).
- **Git.**
- **Disk space for the environment:** about 7 GB with the default CUDA build of PyTorch on Linux, or about 2 GB
  with the [CPU-only build](#cpu-only-pytorch).
- **On a minimal or headless Linux system**, the Qt libraries PyQt6 needs at import time. On Ubuntu 24.04:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libegl1 libgl1 libxkbcommon0 libfontconfig1 libdbus-1-3 libnss3 libxcomposite1 \
      libxdamage1 libxrandr2 libxtst6 libxkbfile1 libgbm1 libasound2t64
  ```

  Desktop Linux installs usually have these already.

## 2. Install

### With venv and pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fixmeseb/Theta-IDE.git
cd Theta-IDE
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

### With uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) can also download a supported Python for you, which helps when your system
Python is 3.14:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fixmeseb/Theta-IDE.git
cd Theta-IDE
uv venv --python 3.12 venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

### Extras

| Extra | Adds |
|---|---|
| `gui` | The desktop IDE: PyQt6, PyQt6-WebEngine, psutil, pywinpty (Windows), and `arxiv` and `truststore` for the arXiv panel |
| `dev` | pytest (with coverage and timeouts), ruff, mypy and pre-commit |
| `atari` | OCAtari and HackAtari, for object-centric Atari environments |
| `video` | pygame, vidmaker and OpenCV, for rendering and recording NUDGE environments |
| `all` | All of the above |

The IDE runs the training pipeline in-process, so the pipeline and the `gui` extra must be installed in the
same environment. There is no separate frontend environment or server.

### CPU-only PyTorch

On Linux, pip installs the CUDA build of PyTorch by default. Without an NVIDIA GPU,
install the CPU build instead:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]" --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

With uv, also pass `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match`.

---

## 3. Launch the IDE

From the repository root, with the environment active:

```bash
python -m frontend
```

That is the only command: there is no server to start first. The status bar shows **Pipeline ready** once the
training pipeline has loaded.

ThetaIDE keeps its workspace (run history, the job queue, workspace settings and the Hub cache) in `.thetaide/`
in the repository. To keep it somewhere else, start the IDE with `python -m frontend --data-dir <path>`.
Settings that apply to every workspace live in `~/.config/thetaide/settings.toml`.

---

## 4. Install components

A fresh clone has no algorithms, models or environments. Install them from the Theta Hub:

1. Open the **Components** tab and click the globe button at the top to open the Hub.
2. Install **ThetaIDE Basics**. It brings Stable-Baselines3, d3rlpy, Gymnasium classic control, Atari and the
   basic network models.

Components are written into the repository (`in/config/` and `src/usr/`) and are not tracked by git. The
README's [Run your first experiment](README.md#run-your-first-experiment) section continues from here.

---

## 5. Verify the install

Install **ThetaIDE Basics** first (step 4): many tests build the default experiment, which needs its models.
Then run:

```bash
pytest tests/ -m "not slow"
```

The GUI tests need a display. On a headless machine, run them with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`. Tests marked
`slow` train for real and take a few minutes; leave out `-m "not slow"` to include them. The whole suite takes
about five minutes.

On a clean install, 12 tests currently fail. They expect experiment groups and fixtures that are no longer in
the repository (for example `mimic` and `pyrenees`), so they are problems in the tests, not in your install.
Any other failure points to a problem with your install.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

**The status bar shows "Pipeline unavailable".** The IDE is not running from the environment the pipeline
is installed in. Activate it, reinstall with `pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"`, and start the IDE again.

**Training fails with `ValueError: badly formed help string`.** You are on Python 3.14. Recreate the
environment with Python 3.10–3.13.

**A run fails because an agent, model or environment is missing.** Install it from the Hub (step 4). The
experiment's recipe names what it needs under `methods:`.

**F1 does not open the documentation.** Your desktop or window manager has claimed F1 (tiling window managers
and some laptops' media keys do). Rebind it in **Settings → Hotkeys**, or use **Help → Documentation**.

**`pip` warns that gymnasium has no extra `accept-rom-license`.** This is harmless: Gymnasium 1.x ships the
Atari ROMs without it.
