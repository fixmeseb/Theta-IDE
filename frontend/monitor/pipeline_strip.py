"""Pipeline strip: the selected run's methods in training order, one segment each, with their events.

run_pipeline.py trains an experiment's methods one after another, so a run is a row of segments: done,
training, or still waiting. A segment is as wide as that method took (or is expected to take), and its
checkpoints, its latest new best and its warnings sit under it as marks. Clicking a segment shows only that method's
curves; clicking it again shows them all.
