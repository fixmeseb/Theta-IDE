"""Where panels come from: the plotters in plot/.

Two tiers, because not every plotter can draw into an Axes someone else
owns. Those that can (BasePlotter.panels()) become composable panels. Those
that build their own figures are offered through plot.capture instead, as
whole figures that can be restyled and exported but not merged into a grid.

Discovery is cached per (plotter, experiment): panels() reloads every
metrics.csv for the run, which is far too slow to repeat on each keystroke
in the styling controls.
