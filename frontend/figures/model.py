"""The figure being composed, with no Qt in it.

A figure is a grid of slots; each filled slot names a panel some plotter can
draw, plus the overrides the researcher applied on top. Keeping that
separate from the widgets means the rules about what a figure *is* run
headless in CI, the same way config_model.py does for the Experiment panel.

Overrides are applied after the plotter has drawn, rather than pushed into
its config beforehand. A plotter decides its own colours from the methods it
finds, so the only point where a specific line can be recoloured by hand is
once it exists on the Axes.

This module never touches frontend/plots.py: run viewing lives there and
figure composition lives here.
